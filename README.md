# datafest-2023
Repository of analysis done for Datafest 2023 at Wesleyan University. 
For this event, we were a team of 5, specifically including: **Freddy Fabian, Sophie Eng, Jadyn George, Ryan Kobayashi and Aleksandra Jacewicz**.

# Overview
At the time of the event, we did not utilize github nor make a github repository, and I am making one now, several months later. With that in mind, I will only be uploding aspects of our larger project that I (Aleksandra Jacewicz) contributed to, specifically with regards to which R code I submitted to our shared Google Drive folder.
